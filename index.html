                                <p class=" mb-4"><span class="text-2xl text-orange-400 font-bold">SellYourComicCollection</span> is a family run business based in the heart of hampshire, that specialises in the collecting, buying, and selling, of comic books, and comic book collections. Oh, another one? I hear you say? Actually no.</p> 
                                <p class="mb-0">The reason our business exists, and what sets us apart from the others, is that we are, at heart, and before all else, collectors. We're not here to make a quick buck and move the comic books on to the next for a quick profit, we're here because of our love of the industry, the collecting game itself, and, of course, the comics. Because of this, you can trust that we will not just be offering fair prices for your treasured comic book collection, but if they don't fit our own collecting criteria, each and every one will be going to people that care for them as much as you once did. With our extensive customer base, we make sure this happens.</p>

                            <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 mt-0 font-bold">Why choose us?</h2>
                            <p class="mb-4">Well, this parts easy. Have you ever tried to sell a comic collection? Or even just a few comics? If so, you already know the answer to this.</p>
                            <p class="mb-4">Comic books are <span class="text-orange-400 font-bold">Notoriously</span> difficult to shift, be it eBay, Facebook or wherever you choose to list your little stack of treasures. Selling just a few comic books could be months worth of work in itself, not to mention the time taken to research proper selling titles, learn comic book grade assesments (an absolute must), and research which print your book is, the year of publication, or even a place or platform to sell, plus countless other annoying bits that end up ultimately being more time than its worth, especially due to the fact that the average comic book isn't worth much more than the paper it's printed on. On top of this all, there's the unfortunate fact that in this modern day and age, all unprotected transactions run the risk of fraud, or being scammed. There is a LOT of these scams out there, many focusing specifically on people selling items such as these, so please - even if you choose not to take us up on our offer, ensure that you do your research on the techniques that scammers use beforehand.</p>

                                    <p class="text-white w-full">This is the absolute killer when it comes to undertaking a sale yourself. We save you months, and, months of work. One thing you will come to realise if you choose to undertake the work yourself, is that comic books are HARD to sell. The only way to maximise profit is to sell each and every book individually, which is an EXTREMELY long and frustratingly drawn out process. We do all of that so that you don't have to. When you sell your comic collection to us, it takes minutes, not months.</p>

                                    <p class="text-white w-full">Another, and perhaps the most important factor of our process, is security. Comic books and collectibles are highly targetted by professional scammers and fraudsters, who are coming up with new ways to achieve parting you from your items without paying you a penny, every single day. When you sell your comic collection to us, there is no risk. Payments will be sent and verified in your bank account before we even leave your property with the goods, and as a registered limited company, you can trust in us.</p>
